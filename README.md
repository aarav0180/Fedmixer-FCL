## Introduction
🏆 **TimeMixer**, as a fully MLP-based architecture, taking full advantage of disentangled multiscale time series, is proposed to **achieve consistent SOTA performances in both long and short-term forecasting tasks with favorable run-time efficiency**.

🌟**Observation 1: History Extraction** 

Given that seasonal and trend components exhibit significantly different characteristics in time series, and different scales of the time series reflect different properties, with seasonal characteristics being more pronounced at a fine-grained micro-scale and trend characteristics being more pronounced at a coarse macro scale, it is, therefore, necessary to decouple seasonal and trend components at different scales.

<p align="center">

</p>

🌟**Observation 2: Future Prediction** 

Different scales exhibit complementary predictive capabilities when integrating forecasts from different scales to obtain the final prediction results.

<p align="center">
<img src="./figures/motivation2.png"  alt="" align=center />
</p>

## Overall Architecture
TimeMixer as a fully MLP-based architecture with **Past-Decomposable-Mixing (PDM)** and **Future-Multipredictor-Mixing (FMM)** blocks to take full advantage of disentangled multiscale series in both past extraction and future prediction phases.

## Continual Federated TimeMixer

The TimeMixer backbone is unchanged. The opt-in continual layer adds bounded replay memory,
mean-shift drift detection, clustered averaging, and prediction-space mutual distillation.

### Complete SSH/GPU workflow

From the repository root on the SSH machine:

```bash
cd TimeMixer
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
nvidia-smi
python -m pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -c "import torch; print(torch.__version__); print(torch.cuda.is_available()); print(torch.cuda.get_device_name(0) if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'CUDA unavailable')"
```

Run the commands on the Linux GPU host. On some managed Windows machines, importing
scikit-learn may fail with `Application Control policy has blocked this file` while loading
`_dist_metrics`; that is an environment DLL policy issue, not a TimeMixer error.

Download and split the paper's Electricity Consumption Dataset into household clients and
chronological continual-learning tasks:

```bash
python scripts/download_electricity_federated.py \
  --output ./data/electricity_federated \
  --clients 10 \
  --max-rows 1000 \
  --rounds 4 \
  --seq-len 96 \
  --pred-len 96
```

Inspect the generated task manifest and client files:

```bash
python -m json.tool data/electricity_federated/manifest.json | less
head data/electricity_federated/clients/client_000.csv
find data/electricity_federated/clients -name '*.csv' | wc -l
```

The downloader is non-interactive and SSH-safe. Use `--max-rows 0` for the full archive. The
paper uses 89 complete clients, 15-minute samples, and 96 input plus 96 prediction steps; the
default command above deliberately uses only 10 clients and 1,000 rows for development.

Run the ten-value component smoke test without a dataset:

```bash
python -m continual_federated.tiny_demo
```

Run the generic compact TimeMixer CSV smoke runner on any numeric CSV:

```bash
python scripts/run_continual_csv.py \
  --csv ./data/electricity_federated/clients/client_000.csv \
  --target load \
  --limit 1000 \
  --clients 2 \
  --rounds 2
```

The CSV runner is a small single-series smoke path. The Electricity downloader is the
paper-aligned client preparation path above.

Run the FedMixer baseline alone:

```bash
python scripts/compare_fedmixer.py \
  --data-dir ./data/electricity_federated \
  --clients 2 \
  --rounds 4 \
  --limit 1000 \
  --device cuda \
  --mode baseline \
  --output ./output/output.log
```

Run Continual FedMixer alone:

```bash
python scripts/compare_fedmixer.py \
  --data-dir ./data/electricity_federated \
  --clients 2 \
  --rounds 4 \
  --limit 1000 \
  --device cuda \
  --mode continual \
  --output ./output/output.log
```

Run both variants in one command, which is the default:

```bash
python scripts/compare_fedmixer.py \
  --data-dir ./data/electricity_federated \
  --clients 2 \
  --rounds 4 \
  --limit 1000 \
  --device cuda \
  --mode both \
  --output ./output/output.log
```

The baseline keeps clustered averaging and mutual distillation but disables replay memory
and drift detection. The continual variant enables both. The selected results are printed to
the terminal and written to `output/output.log`; the output directory is created automatically.

The commands above are smoke runs using 1,000 rows per client. To run the full Electricity
archive, prepare all rows and clients first:

```bash
python scripts/download_electricity_federated.py \
  --output ./data/electricity_federated \
  --clients 10 \
  --max-rows 0 \
  --rounds 4 \
  --seq-len 96 \
  --pred-len 96
```

Then run the full side-by-side comparison with `--limit 0`:

```bash
python scripts/compare_fedmixer.py \
  --data-dir ./data/electricity_federated \
  --clients 10 \
  --rounds 4 \
  --limit 0 \
  --device cuda \
  --mode both \
  --output ./output/full_output.log
```

Use `--mode baseline` or `--mode continual` instead of `both` for one variant. Full mode
uses every complete sliding window in each temporal task, batched in groups of 32.

### Standard single-client training

The following `run.py` command trains one client with TimeMixer. It is not the multi-client
FedMixer comparison. Add `--continual` to enable replay memory and drift detection:

```bash
python run.py \
  --task_name long_term_forecast \
  --is_training 1 \
  --model_id electricity \
  --model TimeMixer \
  --data custom \
  --root_path ./data/electricity_federated/ \
  --data_path clients/client_000.csv \
  --features S \
  --target load \
  --enc_in 1 \
  --dec_in 1 \
  --c_out 1 \
  --seq_len 96 \
  --label_len 48 \
  --pred_len 96 \
  --down_sampling_layers 1 \
  --down_sampling_window 2 \
  --down_sampling_method avg \
  --train_epochs 1 \
  --batch_size 4 \
  --num_workers 0 \
  --use_gpu True \
  --gpu 0 \
  --continual \
  --memory_size 200 \
  --memory_batch_size 16 \
  --memory_weight 0.1 \
  --drift_threshold 1.0
```

The actual FedMixer baseline and continual comparison commands are the three commands above:
use `--mode baseline` for FedMixer only, `--mode continual` for FedMixer plus continual
learning, or `--mode both` to run and display both. Results are appended to
`output/output.log`.

For the original benchmark experiments, use the supplied scripts:

```bash
bash ./scripts/long_term_forecast/ETT_script/TimeMixer_ETTm1_unify.sh
bash ./scripts/long_term_forecast/ECL_script/TimeMixer_unify.sh
bash ./scripts/long_term_forecast/Traffic_script/TimeMixer_unify.sh
bash ./scripts/long_term_forecast/Solar_script/TimeMixer_unify.sh
bash ./scripts/long_term_forecast/Weather_script/TimeMixer_unify.sh
bash ./scripts/short_term_forecast/M4/TimeMixer.sh
bash ./scripts/short_term_forecast/PEMS/TimeMixer.sh
```

Remove downloaded/generated artifacts when finished:

```bash
rm -rf data/electricity_federated data/ETT/ETTh1_tiny.csv
rm -rf checkpoints results test_results
```

### Past Decomposable Mixing 
we propose the **Past-Decomposable-Mixing (PDM)** block to mix the decomposed seasonal and trend components in multiple scales separately. 

<p align="center">
<img src="./figures/past_mixing1.png"  alt="" align=center />
</p>

Empowered by seasonal and trend mixing, PDM progressively aggregates the detailed seasonal information from fine to coarse and dive into the macroscopic trend information with prior knowledge from coarser scales, eventually achieving the multiscale mixing in past information extraction.

<p align="center">
<img src="./figures/past_mixing2.png"  alt="" align=center />
</p>

### Future Multipredictor Mixing 
Note that **Future Multipredictor Mixing (FMM)** is an ensemble of multiple predictors, where different predictors are based on past information from different scales, enabling FMM to integrate complementary forecasting capabilities of mixed multiscale series.

## Main Results
We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance and efficiency of TimeMixer, covering long-term and short-term forecasting, including 18 real-world benchmarks and 15 baselines.
**🏆 TimeMixer achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance in all benchmarks**, covering a large variety of series with different frequencies, variate numbers and real-world scenarios.

### Long-term Forecasting

To ensure fairness in model comparison, experiments were performed with standardized parameters, including aligned input lengths, batch sizes, and training epochs. Additionally, given that results in various studies often stem from hyperparameter optimization, we include outcomes from comprehensive parameter searches.

## Model Abalations

To verify the effectiveness of each component of TimeMixer, we provide the detailed ablation study on every possible design in both Past-Decomposable-Mixing and Future-Multipredictor-Mixing blocks on all 18 experiment benchmarks （see our paper for full results 😊）.

</p>

## Model Efficiency
We compare the running memory and time against the latest state-of-the-art models under the training phase, where TimeMixer consistently demonstrates favorable efficiency, in terms of both GPU memory and running time, for various series lengths (ranging from 192 to 3072), in addition to the consistent state-of-the-art performances for both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks.
**It is noteworthy that TimeMixer, as a deep model, demonstrates results close to those of full-linear models in terms of efficiency. This makes TimeMixer promising in a wide range of scenarios that require high model efficiency.**
